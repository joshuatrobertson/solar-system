# **3D Solar System Simulation**

## 

🚀 **Explore the solar system in 3D!**  
This project uses **Three.js** to create an interactive simulation of the solar system, complete with orbiting planets aligned with real-world physics, a glowing Sun, and a background of 10,000 distant stars.

---

## 🌌 **Features**

- **Realistic Planetary Values**: The speed, scaled distance from sun, scaled radius, speed and rotation all align with real-world values. Only the distance from the sun is scaled. [See for details](/planet_cals)
- **Starry Background**: A visually immersive starfield surrounds the system.  
- **Dynamic Sun**: A glowing Sun at the center, emitting light to illuminate the planets.  
- **Responsive Design**: Fully interactive with zoom and rotation controls.  
- **Expandable**: Easily add more celestial bodies or customise properties like size, speed, or color.

## 🚀 **Installation**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joshuatrobertson/solar-system.git
   cd 3D-Solar-System
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Navigate to:**:

   ## 🎮 Controls

- **Rotate**: Drag the mouse while holding the left button  
- **Zoom**: Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out  
- **Pan**: Drag the mouse while holding the right button

## 🛠️ Customisation

You can modify the simulation by editing the `config.js` file:

- **Planet Properties**: Adjust size, orbit radius, speed, and texture  
- **Starfield**: Modify the density and position of stars  
- **Lighting**: Customise the Sun's glow and light intensity

## 🌠 Planned Features/ To do

- **Asteroid Belts**: Add asteroid belts between Mars and Jupiter  
- **Comets**: Introduce randomised, moving comets 
- **Planet Info Panels**: Show/ hide planet details panels, make them always face the camera
- **Better customisation of camera controls**: Change the controls to be fully moveable and not focused on a central point
